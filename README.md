# Movie-Recommender

Movie Recommender System ðŸŽ¥ðŸ“Š<br>
This project showcases a Movie Recommender System built using machine learning techniques. It leverages the TMDB dataset from Kaggle to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences.
<br>
Key Features
Recommendation Types:
<br><br>
Content-Based Filtering: Recommendations are generated by analyzing movie metadata like genre, cast, and keywords.
Collaborative Filtering (optional): Enhances recommendations using user behavior and preferences.
Dataset:<br>
Utilizes the TMDB dataset, which includes rich information about movies, such as genres, popularity, ratings, and more.
<br><br>
Technologies Used:<br>
<br>
Python for implementation and analysis.
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and preprocessing.
Scikit-learn for building the recommendation model.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.<br><br>
Performance:
Achieves accurate and insightful recommendations through advanced data preprocessing and feature engineering.
